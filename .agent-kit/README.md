# Repository-local agent setup

This directory documents files generated or used by the bootstrap scripts.

The bootstrap scripts:

- find the current Git repository root;
- refuse to write outside that repository;
- create only project-scoped configuration;
- never write to user-home or system-wide agent configuration;
- preserve existing configuration files;
- add a small managed import block to `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`;
- expose `.agents/skills` to Claude Code and Kiro through local adapters;
- rely on Kilo Code's native support for `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills`.
